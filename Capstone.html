    <h1> The day we brought them home </h1>
        The best days of my life are June 12,2023 and July 21st,2023. The day my boys came into my life, Beau Bennett, Loki boki and Scruffy Roughy.
        Raising three Bunnies has been quite the challenge and journey, which I hope to share a bit on this site.

        <h1> Taking care of bunnies </h1>
        <p> Taking care of bunnies has been a journey for sure and everyday I'm learning more about them, 
            One thing I'd like to warn is, You will buy so much chew toys and Hay, so much hay. Yes they are small animals but they eat so much and chew everything (literally will try and chew everthing you own)
            Also cleaning, cleaning is so important, I dont mean bathing them either, thier area they stay, their liters, eating mats etc. My buns free roam in my room and We clean atleast every other day. Which yes my buns get every offended when I clean up their poop. Also making sure they have access to hay and water, thier water fountain we have to clean or add more water almost daily now.
