        <h1> The day we brought them home </h1>
            <p>The best day of my life are June 12,2023 and July 21st,2023. The day my boys came into my life, Beau Bennett, Loki boki and Scruffy Roughy.
            Raising three Bunnies has been quite the challenge and journey, which I hope to share a bit on this site.

        <h1> Taking care of bunnies </h1>
        <p> Taking care of bunnies has been a journey for sure and everyday I'm learning more about them, 
            One thing I'd like to warn is, You will buy so much chew toys and Hay, so much hay. Yes they are small animals but they eat so much and chew everything (literally will try and chew everthing you own)
            Also cleaning, cleaning is so important, I dont mean bathing them either, their area they stay, their litters, eating mats etc. My buns free roam in my room and We clean atleast every other day. Also making sure they have access to hay and water, their water fountain we have to clean or add more water almost daily now. 
        </p>

        </ol>
        <p> Here I'd like to list some things you should get before your bun comes home </p>
        <ol> 
            <li> A litter, we found one on amazon that is a rabbit large size litter box ( I put the link at the bottom if you'd like to see) also need to be careful what you use for litter in the litter box, we use shreded paper and hay to help soak up their pee. </li>
            
            <li> Water dish, we've gone through 3 different types and found the water fountain works for our buns (link at the bottom of what we use) </li>
            
            <li> Food dish or foraging matt for their food. I mainly use the matt to help them eat slower </li>
            
            <li> Toys, mainly chew toys, they will go through it all quickly, I have to buy new ones each week but mind you I do have three</li>
            
            <li> Making a safe dark space away from humans and/or other animals. I found with my Buns they aren't as social but given what they went through it's understandable. </li>
            
            <li> Hay, technically this should be at the top because you will go through alot of hay, they get unlimited hay access and we also have it in their litter to help soak up their pee </li>
            
            <li> Treats! and Snacks, fruit and vegetables are our go-to snack, but you have to limit how much you give, especially with fruit. Fruit has alot of natural sugars in it, so you don't give them to much. There are other treats you can buy or make at home that has hay in it, We buy them but don't give them it to often. </li>
           
            <li> Lastly, Wires. Man they love to chew everything you own. They love wires and I swear they can sniff them out sometimes. I have the walls blocked so they dont get to my walls or cords. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Although Buns are usually good at cleaning themselves, it's still best to brush their fur atleast every other day, checking their nail and teeth growth often is also good. The whole point in their chew toys is so they trim their teeth. You don't want their front teeth over grown.  </p>
