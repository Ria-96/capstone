    <h1> The day we brought them home </h1>
        The best days of my life are June 12,2023 and July 21st,2023. The day my boys came into my life, Beau Bennett, Loki boki and Scruffy Roughy.
        Raising three Bunnies has been quite the challenge and journey, which I hope to share a bit on this site.

        <h1> Taking care of bunnies </h1>
        <p> Taking care of bunnies has been a journey for sure and everyday I'm learning more about them, 
            One thing I'd like to warn is, You will buy so much chew toys and Hay, so much hay. Yes they are small animals but they eat so much and chew everything (literally will try and chew everthing you own)
            Also cleaning, cleaning is so important, I dont mean bathing them either, their area they stay, their litters, eating mats etc. My buns free roam in my room and We clean atleast every other day. Also making sure they have access to hay and water, their water fountain we have to clean or add more water almost daily now.

        <p> Here I'd like to list some things you should get before your bun comes home </p>
        <ol> 
            <li> A litter, we had purchased one but it was still to big for them when we got them, so we cut up a small-meduim size box for them to use til they grew into the one we bought </li>
            
            <li> water dish, we've gone through 3 different types and found the water fountain works for our buns </li>
            
            <li> Food dish or foraging matt for their food. I mainly use the matt to help them eat slower </li>
            
            <li> toys, mainly chew toys, they will go through it all quickly, I have to buy new ones each week but mind you I do have three</li>
            
            <li> Making a safe dark space away from humans and/or other animals. I found with my Buns they aren't as social but given what they went through it's understandable. </li>
            
            <li> Hay, technically this should be at the top because you will go through alot of hay, they get unlimited hay access and we also have it in their litter to help soak up their pee </li>
            
            <li> litter, We like to use shredded paper, we did the rookie mistake and got wood shaving but found out that isn't actually good to have for little buns </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Although Buns are usually good at cleaning themselves, it's still best to brush their fur atleast every other day, checking their nail and teeth growth often is also good. The whole point in their chew toys is so they trim their teeth. You don't want their front teeth over grown.  </p>
